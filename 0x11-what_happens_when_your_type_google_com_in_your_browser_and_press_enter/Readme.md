When you type https://www.google.com into your browser and press Enter, there is a series of steps that occur behind the scenes that allow you to access the Google website. In this blog post, we will break down each step of the process and explain what happens when you make a request to a website.

### 1. DNS Request
The first step is that your browser sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server to translate the URL "www.google.com" into an IP address. The DNS server then returns the IP address associated with the domain name to your browser.

### 2. TCP/IP
The next step is establishing a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server using an Internet Protocol (IP) address. Your browser sends a SYN packet to the server, which responds with a SYN-ACK packet. Your browser then sends an ACK packet, establishing the connection between your computer and the server.

### 3. Firewall
Before any data is transmitted, the server may pass through a firewall. The firewall inspects the incoming traffic to make sure it is safe to proceed. If it detects any malicious activity or anything suspicious, the connection will be blocked.

### 4. HTTPS/SSL
If the connection is not blocked, the server will request a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate from the website to encrypt the data that will be transmitted between your computer and the server. The SSL certificate confirms the server's identity and ensures that the data being transmitted is secure.

### 5. Load-balancer
After the SSL certificate is verified, the request is sent to a load-balancer. Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to improve responsiveness and availability of applications, websites, and databases. The load-balancer will determine which server to send the request to based on the server's current load and availability.

### 6. Web Server
The load-balancer then forwards the request to a web server, which hosts the website. The web server retrieves the requested web page from its local storage or from another server.

### 7. Application Server
If the web page requested is dynamic and requires database access or processing, the web server forwards the request to an application server. The application server retrieves data from the database and performs any necessary processing before sending the data back to the web server.

### 8. Database
If the requested web page requires data from a database, the application server queries the database and retrieves the necessary data.

### 9. Data is returned
Finally, the requested data is returned to the application server, which sends the response back to the web server. The web server then sends the response back to your browser, which renders the web page for you to view.

In conclusion, accessing a website involves several steps, including a DNS request, establishing a TCP/IP connection, passing through a firewall, verifying the SSL certificate, load-balancing, communicating with a web server, and, if necessary, an application server and database. Understanding this process is crucial for anyone working in the web development or software engineering field, as it helps to troubleshoot issues that may arise during website development and maintenance.
